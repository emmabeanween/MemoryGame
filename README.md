# MemoryGame

A basic game app where a user is initially shown a GridView with 6 pairs of images, with all invisible. The user has a small amount of time to match all the pairs. When a panel is clicked in the gridview, the image becomes visible for a couple seconds.
It becomes permanently visible if its matching image is shown, in which case the pair is made visible.
